# Known bugs and workarounds

## Web portal
- **Operations (copy, move, delete, lock) on folders containing large amounts of data cause an "internal error"**

Usually the operation finishes succesfully in the background. So please ignore the error and check back later. 

- **Automatic log out**

After 15 minutes of inactivity you are automatically logged out, the page you were on is still visible, but clicking anything on the page will result in an "internal error". Reloading the page (press F5) will show the login screen.

We will increase the time before you are locked out on the next upgrade. But remmember, it is good practice to lock your laptop when you leave your desk.

- **Copying large datasets (>10.000 files) to the vault fails**

This will occur once the datamanager accepts a Vault submission. The Research folder will show a status "Accepted", normally this changes to "Submitted" once the system has finished copying the dataset to the vault, but this never finishes.

SURF has assured us this problem will be fixed after an upgrade of the underlying system in October.

Please hold of from submitting large datasets for now. Contact us if you have a pressing reason to archive or publish a large dataset on short notice.
