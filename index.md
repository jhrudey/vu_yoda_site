# Welcome
Welcome to the Yoda user help pages.

Yoda is a service that provides Vrije Universiteit researchers and their partners with a workspace and an archive that enables them 
to collaborate, deposit, publish and preserve research data.

Yoda is currently in a "pre-production" phase as part of the [Research Support Program](https://ub.vu.nl/nl/Images/DEF_VUAmsterdamResearchSupporProgrammeA3-HR-zonder_tcm253-934314.pdf) in collaboration with Surf and Utrecht University.
Full implementation is expected in 2022.

Yoda is agnostic to the type of research data which can be for instance text 
files, videos, images, spreadsheets, analysis data such as R, STATA, Matlab, datasheets, source code.  
Eventually Yoda will support the processing of both sensitive (e.g. privacy, patent) and open data.

This website has practical information on the use of the Yoda for users starting in Yoda. More information can
be found on the [SURFsara Knowledge Base](https://servicedesk.surfsara.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Yoda+Hosting).
