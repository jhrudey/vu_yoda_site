# Welcome
Welcome to the Yoda user help pages. 

Yoda is a service that provides Vrije Universiteit researchers and their partners with a workspace and an archive that enables them 
to collaborate, deposit, publish and preserve research data.

Yoda is agnostic to the type of research data which can be for instance text 
files, videos, images, spreadsheets, analysis data such as R, STATA, Matlab, datasheets, source code.  
Yoda supports the processing of both sensitive (e.g. privacy, patent) and open data.
 
Yoda is run by a corporate multidisciplinary 
[Research Data Management team](https://ub.vu.nl/nl/Images/DEF_VUAmsterdamResearchSupporProgrammeA3-HR-zonder_tcm253-934314.pdf) in collaboration with Surf and Utrecht University
using the [Yoda Data Management System](https://github.com/search?q=topic:yoda+org:UtrechtUniversity).

This website has practical information on the use of the Yoda for users starting in Yoda as well as advanced users.
