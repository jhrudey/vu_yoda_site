# Welcome to Yoda
Welcome to the Yoda user help pages. This website has practical information on the use of the Yoda for users [starting with Yoda](getting-started/index.html). 
 
YODA is available for every VU researcher. If you need project space to store data for your research project, you can [request it via a form](getting-started/requesting-space.html).

# NOTICE - Service Disruption: Planned Yoda Upgrade February 22, 2024
Please be kindly advised that on February 22, 2024, Yoda services will unavailable.

An upgrade of services will take place between 6:00 AM and 6:00PM on February 22, 2024.  
The main upgrade feature is the deployment of SRAM, which will further improve platform security by supporting multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users. 

All existing users are required to validate their accounts at least once through SRAM upon receiving a system notification, more information in [this document](docs/YODA_Upgrade_1.9_SRAM_INFO_Users_v02_20240206.pdf)

## What is YODA?
YODA is an application for institutions that supports RDM throughout the entire research cycle: from the safe and easy storage and sharing of data during the research process, to the sharing of data within research groups and projects and ultimately to research data archiving and publication.

## YODA and FAIR data
YODA helps the researcher make their data “FAIR” by providing a solution that enables data discovery and sharing (i.e. findable, accessible). In addition, it facilitates and enforces the use of metadata, thereby, contributing to data interoperability and reusability. YODA provides a platform for the implementation of standard workflows that can ensure metadata quality satisfies (institutional) policy requirements, for example, for data archiving and publication. In addition, YODA’s integration with iRODS forms a single platform that accommodates both researchers with data heavy requirements, as well as those seeking an accessible, user-friendly solution.
## YODA for the researcher
YODA makes use of [iRODS](https://irods.org) as a foundation technology. However, it is much easier to use thereby making it more accessible to a wide range of researchers.

YODA presents researchers a comfortable, easy-to-use solution for the safe storage, sharing and organisation of research data that follows internationally accepted FAIR data principles. Something increasingly demanded by both their institutions and funding organisations (such as the NWO).

The following features make YODA particularly attractive for researchers (end-users): 
- Easy-to-use (web-based, graphical user interface and the WebDAV interface)
- Supports the entire research process from data acquisition to publication
- Supports standardised workflows for the storage and archiving of research data.
- Direct coupling between data and metadata (including flexible metadata schemas)
- Data publication and the associated minting of Digital Object Identifiers (DOI’s)
- A flexible integration with iRODS that also caters for (very) data-intensive research.
