# Release notes Yoda version 1.5 (tba)

Version: 1.5

Released: tba

## New features since Yoda version 1.4
- New metadata form based on JSON schema
- Support for metadata schema identifiers
- Check for unpreservable files in your datasets
- Several UX improvements to the research space
- Script to check vault integrity

## Upgrading from Yoda version 1.4
Upgrade is supported by Ansible (2.7.x).

Instance specific rulesets (e.g. i-lab) are merged with irods-ruleset-uu and can be removed from the configuration (rulesets).

All metadata on the system needs to be migrated to add a schema identifier after the upgrade.
This can be one by running the following command:
```bash
irule -F /etc/irods/irods-ruleset-research/tools/check-metadata-for-schema-updates.r
```

When all metadata has a schema identifier the system default schema can be [upgraded](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/yoda-docs/administration/upgrading-metadata-schemas.html).
