# Yoda metadata
As a Yoda user, you can add metadata to annotate your data package. 
Metadata is optional in the research space. However, metadata is required whenever
a data package is published or deposited in the vault. 

The Yoda portal presents a form to facilitate editing of the metadata. The result is stored
in a metadata file on Yoda named yoda-metadata.json. 
Alternatively, you can edit this file manually or use tools to automatically generate its content.
   
The metadata file content needs to comply with JSON specifications and needs to be formatted
according to a JSON schema.  Each Yoda community can opt to have its own metadata schema and hence
its own set of metadata fields.
