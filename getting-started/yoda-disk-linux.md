# Connecting to the Yoda Network Disk on Linux

GNOME users can connect to the Yoda Network Disk using [GNOME Files](yoda-disk-gnome-files.md) (also known as Nautilus in older versions of GNOME).

Alternatively, if you are comfortable with using commandline tools, utilize [davfs2](yoda-disk-davfs2.md) to mount the Yoda Network Disk.
