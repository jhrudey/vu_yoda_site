# Connecting to the Yoda Network Disk on MacOS

You can open the Yoda Network Disk using the Finder app. By default, the Finder icon is shown in the bottom left corner of your screen, in the Dock. Click on this icon.

If you don't see the Finder icon, you can alternatively start Finder by pressing the command key and the space bar, then typing "finder" and pressing enter.

Now press the command key and the "K" key to connect to the Yoda server. You should now see this dialog:

Enter https://data.yoda.vu.nl/ as server address.

The Finder app will show a confirmation dialog, similar to the one below. The address shown in the dialog should be the address you entered in the previous dialog.

You should now see a credentials dialog. The "Connect as" setting should be set to "Registered user".
If you are an employee or student at Utrecht University, your user name is your Utrecht University email address (in lowercase) and your password
is your Solis password. External users have usually received their user name via email, along with a link to set their password. Tick the checkbox &ldquo;Remember this password
in my keychain&rdquo;.  Click on the connect button.

You should now have a new Yoda Network Disk location in Finder. Its name is the network address you entered before. You may have to scroll down in finder in order to see it.

You can also connect using Cyberduck on MacOS, see [connect using cyberduck](yoda-disk-cyberduck)
