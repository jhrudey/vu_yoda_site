# Connecting to the Yoda Network Disk using YodaDrive

This page explains how to connect to the Yoda Network Disk from a Windows PC using YodaDrive

Generally speaking, YodaDrive is the recommended application for connecting to the Yoda Network Disk on a Windows system.
However, in some specific situations 
the [Windows native WebDAV client](yoda-disk-windowsnative.md) is a better alternative: 
- If you need to be able to connect to multiple Yoda environments simultaneously.
- If you can't install YodaDrive, for example if the security settings of your laptop
  prevent you from installing any new applications.
- YodaDrive is intended for use with Windows 10. If you use Windows 7 and are unable to upgrade,
  you can still use the native WebDAV client to connect to the Yoda Network Disk as a temporary workaround.

Wait until the installation is complete. You should have a new shortcut on your desktop, as well as an icon in your system tray.
By default, the system tray icon is shown in the lower right corner of the screen, to the left of the clock.

If you don't see it, expand the system tray using the &ldquo;^&rdquo; button, and check whether you see the YodaDrive icon in the expanded
tray.

Open the YodaDrive configuration by clicking on the system tray icon and choosing &ldquo;Manage&rdquo;.  You should now see a management
window. If you donâ€™t see it, minimize your other open application windows to see if the YodaDrive window is behind it.

Enter your user name in the &ldquo;Login&rdquo; field and your password in the &ldquo;Password&rdquo; field.
If you are an employee or student at Utrecht University, your user name is your Utrecht University email address (in lowercase) and your password
is your Solis password. External users have usually received their user name via email, along with a link to set their password.

If you are working on your personal PC or laptop, tick the checkbox &ldquo;Remember Password&rdquo;. If you are working on a shared computer, it is
better not to tick this checkbox for security reasons. Tick the checkboxes &ldquo;Auto-mount drive&rdquo; and &ldquo;Start with Windows&rdquo;.

Click &ldquo;Save&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Mount&rdquo;.

You can now view the Yoda Network Disk in Explorer.
