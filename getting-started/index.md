# Getting started with Yoda
You can access Yoda in two ways: via a network drive in your file manager or client software and through the website portal.

## The Yoda Portal
[The Yoda Portal](getting-started-portal.html) In the web portal you can arrange who gets access to your data, 
archive data and publish data. This is not possible via a network drive. In addition, you can upload (via drag and drop)
and download files, although this might be slower than using Yoda as a network drive.

## The Yoda Network Drive
Within the network drive, you work with your files just as you normally would do while using your file explorer. 
You will need to install or configure a WebDAV client.

To configure Yoda as a network drive see [getting started with the Yoda Network Drive](getting-started-drive.html).
